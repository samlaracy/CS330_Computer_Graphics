# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
When using new libraries and existing functions, I examined how each one worked to ensure my desired functionality. In the past I would sometimes not pay attention to how these libraries and functions worked, but that could result in errors and potentially insecure code.
# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I used the software development life cycle design process.
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The software development life cycle can be repeated in most software development projects, as it's deisgned with reusability in mind. 
# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used more testing to ensure that the changes I made to the code has their desired functionality.
# How did iteration factor into your development?
As long as the window for the program remains open, the program will constantly render the scene in a while loop.
# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Beforehand I wasn't concerned with how messy my code was, but I became annoyed by how hard it was to find pieces of code. Instead, I tried my best to ensure code was not repeated.
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This was a very unique class for me, and I learned to look at code in a new way. I hadn't thought about the visual elements of my code before, so the skills I learned in this class have given me a new perspective on how I develop code within a 3D environment.
